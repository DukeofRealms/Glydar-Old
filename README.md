Glydar
=====

An open source Java implementation of Cube World's server.

**Status:** Client will connect (if it's the correct version) and be dropped into a world, be welcomed, and then do nothing of use.

**Snapshot builds** are available at http://ci.glydar.org

Building and running
-----
If you are using *Maven* from the commandline, simply run `mvn clean build package`

If you are using *Eclipse* first install the m2e (Maven to Eclipse) plugin then:

1. Import the project from File -> Import -> Project from Git.
2. When asked, import as a general project.
3. Right click on the project, select Configure -> Convert to a Maven Project.
4. Have fun :)

If you are using *IntelliJ* or any other Maven-enabled IDE, the project should work out of the box.
